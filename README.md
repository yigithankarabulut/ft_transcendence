## Introduction
This project aims to create an enhanced version of the Pong game with a focus on scalability, security, and advanced gameplay features. By leveraging microservices architecture and modern web technologies, we've built a robust platform that goes beyond the traditional Pong experience.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Backend designed as microservices for improved scalability and maintainability. Each service has its own database.
- **User Management**: Standard user management system with authentication across tournaments.
- **Remote Authentication**: Implement secure remote authentication for users.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhanced security with 2FA and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **AI Opponent**: Challenge yourself against an intelligent AI player.
- **Remote Multiplayer**: Play against other players remotely.
- **Server-Side Pong**: Core game logic implemented on the server for fair play.
- **RESTful API**: Full-featured API for game interactions and data management.
- **Frontend Framework**: Modern, responsive user interface built with a frontend framework/toolkit.
- **Database Integration**: Robust data management using a backend database.

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yigithankarabulut/ft_transcendence.git
   cd ft_transcendence
   ```

2. **Edit .env file**\
  Edit .env file for both frontend and backend with necessary configurations

4. **Run with Docker Compose**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Architecture
Our microservices architecture includes the following components:

1. **API Gateway**\
  Entry point for client requests, routing to appropriate services
2. **Authentication Service**\
  Provides authentication for requests to internal services. ApiGateway sends requests to the auth service as a middleware for all requests except Excluded Routes
3. **User Management Service**\
  Manages user management and authentication
4. **Friend Service**\
  Handles users' friendships.
5. **Bucket Service**\
  Service that stores and serves files such as Media, Photo, etc.
6. **Game Playing Service**\
  Service that processes the game on the server side. It has a Websocket consumer and connects to wss.
7. **Game Service**\
  Manages game logic and state
8. **Mail Service**\
  A consumer that consumes RabbitMQ. Asnyc handles cases such as 2FA code, Email verification, Forgot Password.
9. **Status Service**\
  Handles online/offline status of users.
